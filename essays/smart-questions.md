“There’s no such thing as a stupid question”, a common phrase used by teachers around the world, but after reading [How To Ask Questions The Smart Way]( http://www.catb.org/esr/faqs/smart-questions.html), one has to ask, are there stupid questions?

##What is a “Smart” Question?

###Example

###Counter Example
<blockquote>What is the difference between == and === in JavaScript? I have also seen != and !== operators. Are there more such operators? <footer>[StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/523643/difference-between-and-in-javascript)</footer></blockquote>
Having gone through a few programming courses, I know that the answer to this question is covered when going over conditional statements; I can only assume that this person is either not paying attention in class or attempting to skip some reading assignments.  To add to their laziness, they did not even take the time to search for the answer before posting their question, since someone had already posted the same question to StackOverflow.
