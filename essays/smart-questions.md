“There’s no such thing as a stupid question”, a common phrase used by teachers around the world, but after reading [How To Ask Questions The Smart Way](http://www.catb.org/esr/faqs/smart-questions.html), one has to ask, are there stupid questions?

## What is a “Smart” Question?
In the article, authors Eric Raymond and Rick Moen go on a rant about various factors that they believe constitute a smart question, but it all boils down to a lack of effort from the person asking the question.

### Example
<blockquote>
  “I've tried checking <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1659208/why-br-and-not-br">other answers</a>, but I'm still confused--especially after seeing <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_img.asp">W3schools HTML 5 reference</a>.<br />I thought HTML 4.01 was supposed to "allow" single-tags to just be &lt;img&gt; and &lt;br&gt;. Then XHTML came along with &lt;img /&gt; and &lt;br /&gt; (<a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/462741/space-before-closing-slash/463692#463692">where someone said that the space is there for older browsers</a>).<br />Now I'm wondering how I'm supposed to format my code when practicing HTML 5.<br />Is it &lt;br&gt;, &lt;br/&gt; or &lt;br /&gt;?”

</blockquote>
This would be considered a smart question due to the level of effort the person seemingly put into figuring out a solution prior to posting, such as the links to resources and other questions they have looked at. 

### Counter Example
<blockquote>
  “What is the difference between == and === in JavaScript? I have also seen != and !== operators. Are there more such operators?”
  <footer><a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/523643/difference-between-and-in-javascript">Shiva on StackOverflow</a></footer>
</blockquote>
Having gone through a few programming courses, I know that the answer to this question is covered when going over conditional statements; I can only assume that this person is either not paying attention in class or attempting to skip some reading assignments.  To add to their laziness, they did not even take the time to search for the answer before posting their question, since someone had already posted the same question to StackOverflow.

## Reflection
This article leaves a lot to be desired.  It is full of seemingly endless ranting and misses a major piece of the puzzle, academia, where you should ask any and all, both smart and stupid, questions to your instructor.  Maybe the person I listed in the counter example above is attempting to teach themselves JavaScript and they don’t otherwise know where to turn to for answers; should we scold them for attempting to learn something just because it seems elementary to us?  No, we should think back to a time when we didn’t know the difference between == and === either, revel in those fond memories for a minute and then help steer them in the right direction.
