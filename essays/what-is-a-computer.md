A computer is a programmable machine that can execute a set of instructions, known as a program, in a defined manner.  Programs describe what a computer does, and any computer can do everything any other computer can do, including running itself.  All computers are not created equal, however; some run slower than others; some can fit in your pocket, others occupy more space than a house; but for all computers, the following three statements are true:
  1. For every computation, there is a program
  2. For every variable, there is a partial evaluator
  3. For every program transformer, there is a fixed program

Computers are capable of many things, such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, searching and any other computation, but they cannot determine if a computation will halt, or any non-trivial predicate thereof, without first running the computation.

The future may hold a different definition of what a computer is.  Our current definition is largely based on work from Alan Turing and others; it is possible that new ideas and concepts will change our perspective, as is the normal progression of science.  I look forward to emerging technologies, such as quantum computers, and their potential impact on the field of computer science.
