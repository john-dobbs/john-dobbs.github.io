Coding standards, you will either love them at first sight or curse the day someone required you use them, but I think they eventually grow on you.

## Beyond Tabs vs Spaces
Although an eternal debate among programmers, using tabs vs spaces is only scratching the surface of what coding standards entail, but it does make for great episode of Silicon Valley.  Coding standards cover all aspects of your code, from formatting, to layout, to naming conventions, and everything in between, all with the intention of improving the readability of your code and allowing it to be easily understood by others.  This can become incredibly useful when working on collaborative projects, even more so as the project size grows.
Looking back on my own experiences, over the years I subconsciously got in the habiting of following some simple formatting techniques that significantly improved the readability of my programs, which ultimately reduced the time to debug any issues.  Although following a coding standard is a rather new concept to me, I can see the benefits to using them.

## Impressions IntelliJ IDEA and ESLint
For my Software Engineering course at UH Manoa, we just started using IntelliJ IDEA.  Although I have experience using Microsoft Visual Studio, using an IDE is another new concept for me, I’ve only used Visual Studio for compiling software I’ve programmed elsewhere.  Some features in IntelliJ IDEA are difficult to get used to when coming from another environment, such as automatically adding closing parentheses and brackets, auto-indenting and auto-complete… I can see these features being useful, especially for those just starting off programming, but it can also cause some confusion if you are not used to it.
